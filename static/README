This folder is used to store project-wide static assets, i.e. JavaScript-files
that are used in the project-wide templates.

=============== Very Important to Read ==============
Top-Level Static Directory: This is the main static directory in your Django project. It's typically located at the root of your project and specified in your settings.py file with the STATICFILES_DIRS setting.

Subdirectories for Different Types of Static Files:

CSS: For all your Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) files. It helps in styling your web pages.
JavaScript: For all your JavaScript (JS) files. This is essential for adding interactive features to your web pages.
Images: For storing all the images used in your website. This includes product images, logos, icons, etc.
Fonts: If you are using custom fonts, itâ€™s good to have them in a separate folder.
Vendor: For third-party libraries and frameworks, like Bootstrap, jQuery, etc. This keeps your third-party code separate from your custom code.
Naming Conventions and Organization:

Use clear and consistent naming conventions for your files.
Organize files in a way that reflects their usage or page-specific styles/scripts.
Versioning for Cache Busting:

Implement a versioning system for your static files to help with cache busting. This can be done through file names or query strings.
Minification and Compression:

Consider setting up a process for minifying and compressing your CSS and JavaScript files for production. This reduces load times and improves performance.
Responsive Assets:

For images, consider having different resolutions for different devices, especially for large product images.
Use of a CDN:

In a production environment, consider serving static files from a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for improved load times.
Django's static and staticfiles Tags:

Use Django's template tags for linking static files in your templates, ensuring the correct path is generated.
Security Considerations:

Regularly update any third-party libraries to mitigate security vulnerabilities.
Testing:

Ensure that static files are correctly collected and served in both development and production environments.
