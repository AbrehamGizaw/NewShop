Top-Level Images Directory: Inside your main static directory, have a dedicated images folder. This is where all image-related files will be stored.

Subdirectories Based on Usage:

Products: Store all product-related images here. Further organization can be done based on categories or product IDs.
   For example, products/electronics, products/clothing, etc., or products/{product_id}.
Banners: For promotional banners, sliders, or any large images used across the site for marketing or promotional purposes.
Icons: Small images/icons used throughout the site, like cart icons, user icons, etc.
Logos: Store different variations and sizes of your website's logo.
Blog: If your site includes a blog, images related to blog posts can be stored here.
Layout: Images used in the website's layout, like background images, patterns, etc.
Thumbnails: Smaller versions of images, especially useful for product listings or gallery views.
Sliders: Any images related to sliders in any page should be stored here.
Pages: If some of the images doesn't fit any of the directories above store them here.
  Follow the pattern: pages/page_name/suitable_category_name/img.png ...

Responsive Image Versions:
Consider having subfolders for different resolutions of the same image, especially for product images,
  to cater to various device sizes (e.g., products/{product_id}/large, products/{product_id}/medium, products/{product_id}/small).

Naming Conventions:
Use clear, descriptive, and consistent naming conventions for your image files.
Include relevant keywords in file names for SEO purposes, like red-dress-front-view.jpg.

Optimization:
Ensure images are optimized for the web (compressed and resized appropriately) to improve page load times.
Consider using modern image formats like WebP for better compression.

Versioning:
Implement a versioning system for images that are frequently updated, to manage caching effectively.

Alt Text:
Although not part of the directory structure, ensure that your images have descriptive alt text for SEO and accessibility.

Backup and Archiving:
Have a system in place for backing up and archiving older or less frequently used images.
